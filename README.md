# Translation Giant

This is a Scrabble cheater, a program, that is sometimes happily called "Scrbble Word Finder". It allows you to define set of letters and search for all words matching your set in three different modes, in Polish and English language. For using this program as standalone tool note, that dictionaries used in this program are very weak, their quality is low and that they haven't been updated for past twelve years (as of writing this). Therefore real usage of this program in high-rank Scrabble games may be impossible.

For Delphi developer this piece of source code may be useful to learn how to quickly search large dictionaries (27k words in Polish and 65k words in English) for finding all words matching given pattern.

**This project ABANDONED! There is no wiki, issues and no support. There will be no future updates. Unfortunately, you're on your own.**

### Status

Last time `.dpr` file saved in Delphi: **17 December 2001**. Last time `.exe` file built: **6 January 2013**.

**You're only getting project's source code and nothing else! You need to find all missing Delphi components by yourself.**

I don't have access to either most of my components used in this or any other of my Delphi projects, nor to Delphi itself. Even translation of this project to English was done by text-editing all `.dfm` and `.pas` files and therefore it may be cracked. It was made in hope to be useful to anyone and for the same reason I'm releasing its source code, but you're using this project or source code at your own responsibility.

Keep in mind, that both comments and names (variables, object) are in Polish. I didn't find enough time and determination to translated them as well. I only translated strings.
